# Clustering-Analysis-of-Contraceptive-Method-Choices-in-Indonesia
This analysis uses a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey donated by Lim (1997) to identify distinct sociodemographic groups with varying degrees of contraceptive non-use.

The dataset has been clustered using several different techniques and can be further built upon using supervised learning techniques on the clusters to identify features within the clusters.
